## 5.2 Tidy Data
### 5.2.1 Exercises

# 1. For each of the sample tables, describe what each observation and each column represents.
# > Each observation in table1 represents the documented number of cases of TB as well as the population in a country in a certain year
# > Each column in table1 represents a variable ('country', 'year', 'cases', 'population').
# > Each observation in table2 represents the count for a specific variable based on the "type" variable ("cases" or "population") for a country in a certain year
# > Each column in table2 represents a variable except for "type" and "count", where "type" is indicates the variable type corresponding to "count"
# > Each observation in table3 represents the rate of tuberculosis in a country's population in a given year. "Rate" is the number of cases divided by the size of the population.
# > Each row in table3 represents a variable.

# 2. Sketch out the process youâ€™d use to calculate the rate for table2 and table3. You will need to perform four operations:
# > table2: filter out rows by country to find rows where type == "cases" and where type == "population" then mutate to store the rate for the specific country
# > table3: for each observation, extract the prefix before '/' and the suffix as "cases" and "population", then mutate and store as double after dividing the two numbers
